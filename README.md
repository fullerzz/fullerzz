## About Me - fullerzz
I'm just a guy from Arizona that thinks software is pretty neat. I spend my days working as a backend software developer writing and maintaining cloud-based applications.
These apps are mostly written in Python and Java with Terraform used for the IAC.

**I'm looking to improve my Go dev skills in 2024!**

## Current Projects
There are a couple repos I plan on continuing development on as the ideas are still interesting to me.

|Name|Description|
|----|-----------|
|[`loamy`](https://github.com/fullerzz/loamy)| Allows you to execute a list of http operations asynchronously from within an synchronous context.|
|[`pi-cloud`](https://github.com/fullerzz/pi-cloud)**\***| Rest API for raspberry pi to enable file hosting on local networks. |

**\*** _The first iteration of this project is written in Python. I'm pretty comfortable with Python, so planning on continuing the development in Go here: https://github.com/fullerzz/picloud_
