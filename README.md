# About Me
I'm just some guy from Arizona that thinks software is pretty neat.

# Current Projects
There are a couple repos I plan on continuing development on as the ideas are still interesting to me.

|Name|Description|

**\*** _The first iteration of this project is written in Python. I'm pretty comfortable with Python, so planning on continuing the development in Go here: https://github.com/fullerzz/picloud_
